# ZenHub Issue Creation Guidelines

## **Purpose**

When a user requests creating a ZenHub issue, extract relevant details, determine the appropriate issue type, and generate a properly formatted issue using ZenHub MCP functions for the <github-repo-name> project.

## **ZenHub Configuration**

- **<project-name> Workspace ID:** <zenhub-workspace-id>
- **GitHub Project:** https://github.com/<github-org-name>/<github-repo-name>

## **Default Repository**

Use <github-repo-name> (GitHub repository) for all issues

## **Pipeline Configuration**

Available ZenHub pipelines in order:

**All issues are created as Ready for Development by default.**

## **Team Members**

Available assignees with their ZenHub and GitHub IDs:

- **Oleksandr Pavliuk** - ZH: `Z2lkOi8vcmFwdG9yL1plbmh1YlVzZXIvMTk4MzI2OQ`, GH: `pavliuko`

If assignee dosn't mentioned specificaly, assign all issues on **Oleksandr Pavliuk**

## **Issue Type Detection**

Automatically determine issue type development level based on user input:

- **Bug** - Problems, errors, crashes, unexpected behavior
- **Feature** - New functionality, enhancements, user stories  
- **Task** - Development tasks, refactoring, technical debt

## **Label Management**

### **Default Behavior**
- **Do NOT set labels by default** unless explicitly requested by the user
- Keep the `labels` parameter as an empty array `[]` in most cases

### **When to Apply Labels**
- User explicitly requests specific labels (e.g., "add priority:high label")

### **Label Examples**
Common labels when requested:
- Component-based: `ui-component`, `api`, `auth`, `network`
- Priority: `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`
- Type-specific: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`
- Platform: `ios`, `android`, `web`

### **Anti-patterns**
- ❌ Adding labels without user request
- ❌ Over-categorizing with multiple labels
- ❌ Using labels for information already captured in issue type

## **Issue Templates**

### **Bug Report Template**

```markdown
## 🐛 Problem Description

*Clear description of what's broken or not working as expected.*

## 📱 Environment

- **iOS Version:** 
- **Device:** 
- **App Version:** 
- **Xcode Version:** (if relevant)

## 🔄 Steps to Reproduce

1. 
2. 
3. 

## ✅ Expected Behavior

*What should happen instead.*

## ❌ Actual Behavior

*What actually happens.*

## 💥 Impact

- **Severity:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- **Frequency:** [Always/Often/Sometimes/Rare]
- **Users Affected:** [All/Subset/Specific scenarios]

## 🔍 Additional Context

*Any other relevant information, error logs, or related issues.*

## 📸 Screenshots/Videos

*Attach visual evidence if applicable.*
```

### **Feature Request Template**

```markdown
## 🎯 Goal

*What problem does this solve or what value does it provide?*

## 👥 User Story

*As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit].*

## 💡 Proposed Solution

*High-level description of the desired functionality.*

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

*Specific, measurable outcomes that define feature completion.*

## 📐 Design Considerations

*UI/UX requirements, platform-specific considerations.*

## 🔗 Dependencies

*Related issues, external dependencies, or prerequisites.*

```

### **Task Template**

```markdown
## 🎯 Objective

*Brief summary of what needs to be done and why (1–2 sentences).*

## 📋 Description

*Detailed description of the task, including context and background.*

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

*Specific, measurable outcomes that define task completion.*

## 🔧 Technical Notes

*Implementation guidance, architectural considerations, or technical constraints.*

```

## **MCP Function Usage**

### **Creating Issues**

Use the appropriate creation function based on repository type, then immediately move to "Ready for development" pipeline:

#### **GitHub Issues** (For <github-repo-name> - Primary Repository)
```
// 1. Create the issue
mcp_zenhub_createGitHubIssue({
  title: "Issue Title", 
  body: "Issue body content",
  repositoryId: "",
  issueTypeId: "appropriate_issue_type_id",
  assignees: ["github_usernames"],
  labels: [] // Empty by default unless user requests specific labels
})

// 2. Move to Ready for development pipeline
mcp_zenhub_moveIssueToPipeline({
  issueId: "created_issue_id",
  pipelineId: "" // Ready for development
})
```

#### **ZenHub Issues** (For internal ZenHub tracking)
```
// 1. Create the issue
mcp_zenhub_createZenhubIssue({
  title: "Issue Title",
  body: "Issue body content",
  repositoryId: "",
  issueTypeId: "appropriate_issue_type_id",
  assigneeIds: ["assignee_zenhub_ids"],
  labels: [] // Empty by default unless user requests specific labels
})

// 2. Move to Ready for development pipeline
mcp_zenhub_moveIssueToPipeline({
  issueId: "created_issue_id",
  pipelineId: "" // Ready for development
})
```

## **Title Guidelines**

`Component: Brief description`

### **Best Practices**
- Keep titles under 60 characters
- Use active voice and clear language
- Include a prefix to indicate the responsible team: (DEV) for Development.
- Include component/area when relevant
- Examples:
  - `SignIn: Email validation fails for special characters`
  - `Add biometric authentication to login flow`
  - `Refactor NetworkAPI error handling`
  - `User onboarding experience`

## **Quality Guidelines**

### **Issue Body Requirements**
- Use clear, actionable language
- Include specific acceptance criteria for features/tasks (no checkboxes)
- Provide reproduction steps for bugs
- Focus on user needs and business value
- Include relevant technical context

### **Avoid Anti-patterns**
- ❌ Vague titles like "Fix login"
- ❌ Missing acceptance criteria
- ❌ Using checkbox lists in acceptance criteria
- ❌ Implementation details in user stories
- ❌ Duplicate issues without cross-referencing
- ❌ Missing reproduction steps for bugs

## **Post-Creation Actions**

### **Required Issue Link**
**REQUIRED:** Always end your message with a hyperlink to the created issue in markdown format:
```markdown
🔗 [**Issue #[number]:**](https://app.zenhub.com/<workspace-id>/[number])
```

This link should be the very last line of your response to ensure users can easily access the issue in ZenHub.
