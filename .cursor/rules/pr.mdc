# Pull Request Creation Guidelines

Pull request must be created using the GitHub CLI (`gh`).

## PR Title

- Keep it short and descriptive.
- Use the same format as your commit message (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`).
- Avoid ticket numbers in the title — include them in the footer if needed.
- Emojis are optional but can help clarify intent (see below).

### Emojis (Optional but Encouraged)

Using emojis in PR titles can make intent clearer at a glance.

#### Tips
- Use **one emoji per title**, before the summary.
- Keep usage **consistent across the project/team**.

#### Suggested Emoji Mapping
