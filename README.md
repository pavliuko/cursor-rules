# Purpose

This repository contains a structured set of Cursor scan rules designed to promote best practices, code quality, and modern architectural clarity. Each rule is documented, categorized, and hyperlinked for easy reference and adoption in your projects.

## Rule Index

### 🧹 Clean Code & Commit Hygiene

- [commit-message.mdc](rules/commit-message.mdc): Well-written commit messages help your future self and teammates understand the "why" behind changes. Provides structure, conventions, and recommended tags for commit messages.

### 🏗️ SwiftUI Architecture

- [forget-mvvm-by-Dimillian.mdc](rules/forget-mvvm-by-Dimillian.mdc): Inspired by Thomas Ricouard's article, this rule advocates for modern SwiftUI architecture, discouraging legacy MVVM patterns and promoting native state management, unidirectional data flow, and feature-based organization.

### 🌀 Miscellaneous

- [ask-first.mdc](rules/ask-first.mdc): Before starting any investigation or work, always ask what exactly needs to be done. Don't dive into the code without knowing the task; confirm your understanding before taking action.
