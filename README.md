# Purpose

This repository contains a curated set of Cursor scan rules to guide code quality, architecture, and collaboration practices. Each rule is documented for clarity and grouped by theme for easy discovery. Use these rules to maintain consistency and best practices across your projects.

- [Commit Message Guidelines](rules/commit-message.mdc): Well-written commit messages help your future self and teammates understand the "why" behind changes.

### 🏗️ Architecture & Patterns
- [SwiftUI 2025 Architecture Rules](rules/forget-mvvm-by-Dimillian.mdc): *(Inspired by Thomas Ricouard's article: SwiftUI in 2025: Forget MVVM)*\  
Core principles for modern SwiftUI app architecture: embrace declarative patterns, avoid legacy MVVM, and organize code by feature.
